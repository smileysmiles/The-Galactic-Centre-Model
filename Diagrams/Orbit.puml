CORE --> STABLE
STABLE --> MANAGED
MANAGED --> DRIFT
DRIFT --> COLLAPSE

note right of GC
Core capabilities increase pull.
This is intentional: heavier but survivable.
end note

note bottom
Inward drift is the default.
Outward drift requires effort.
Failure occurs when inward drift outpaces outward capacity.
