title Pull vs Push — Event Horizon as Economic Irreversibility
skinparam shadowing false

rectangle "Inward pull (debt accumulation)\nRate increases with coupling/complexity" as PULL
rectangle "Outward push (debt repayment)\nCapacity depends on structure + delivery bandwidth" as PUSH
rectangle "Event Horizon\nReversal cost > rebuild cost\n(irreversibility threshold)" as EH

PULL --> EH : If pull rate outpaces push
PUSH --> EH : If push capacity falls

note right of EH
Crossed when:
- reversal cost exceeds rebuild
- refactor becomes irrational
- only isolation/replace makes sense
end note

note bottom
Good architecture reduces the cost-per-unit of outward push,
especially near core capabilities where pull is strongest.
