How Architectural Principles (APs) and Kaizen Work Together
The Short Version

Architectural Principles (APs) set the rules of the system

Kaizen improves things within those rules

ADRs change the rules deliberately

Drift is inevitable — direction is a choice

If you remember nothing else, remember this:

APs decide where we are allowed to be.
Kaizen keeps us safely in orbit.

What Architectural Principles Are

APs are:

Explicit constraints

Opinionated by design

Applied unevenly depending on criticality

Fixed at a point in time

They exist to:

Prevent accidental centralisation

Protect core capabilities

Make trade-offs explicit

Reduce re-litigation of fundamentals

What APs Are Not

APs are not:

Living documents

Consensus artefacts

Best-practice lists

Continuously revised guidance

They represent a deliberate position in time.

What Kaizen Is (Here)

Kaizen is:

Continuous improvement

Local and incremental

Reversible

Always subordinate to APs

Kaizen is used to:

Improve quality

Reduce risk

Simplify implementations

Expose technical and architectural pressure

Kaizen is not used to:

Change system direction

Redefine boundaries implicitly

Bypass APs “just this once”

Introduce new gravity silently

Kaizen by Orbit (Galaxy Model)
Orbit	AP Strength	Kaizen Style	Focus
Centre / Core	Strong	Conservative	Stability, correctness, risk
Inner Orbits	Directional	Boundary-focused	Prevent inward drift
Outer Orbits	Light	Fast & experimental	Learning, speed

The closer you are to the centre, the more careful Kaizen must be.

Drift and Improvement

All systems drift inwards over time

Kaizen alone does not prevent this

APs give Kaizen direction

Unchecked Kaizen can:

Strengthen the centre accidentally

Increase coupling

Raise future change cost

Kaizen aligned with APs:

Pays down debt deliberately

Prepares systems for extraction

Keeps gravity intentional

Kaizen vs Architecture

Clear boundary:

Kaizen stops where direction changes begin.

Kaizen → local, reversible improvements

APs / ADRs → deliberate, directional decisions

If Kaizen repeatedly hits an AP:

That’s a signal

The outcome is an ADR or new AP

Not erosion by exception

Changing or Adding APs (In Brief)

APs are never edited in place

They are replaced or versioned

Old APs remain as historical record

Kaizen can surface the need for change —
it cannot authorise it.

Why This Matters

This model:

Enables improvement without chaos

Makes “no” principled, not personal

Keeps core systems stable

Keeps edge systems fast

Removes architecture-by-stealth

It replaces process with intentional control.
