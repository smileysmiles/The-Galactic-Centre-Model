# Glossary

- **Inward drift**: natural accumulation of coupling, constraint, and debt over time.
- **Outward drift**: deliberate debt repayment that restores reversibility (seams, simplification).
- **Core capabilities**: truths that must centralise (ledger/identity/eligibility/audit) and increase pull.
- **Event horizon**: point where reversal cost exceeds rebuild cost.
- **Orbit**: a qualitative region describing debt interest rate and survivability.
